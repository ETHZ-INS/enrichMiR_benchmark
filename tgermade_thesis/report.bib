	abstract = {Gene expression is the fundamental level at which the result of various genetic and regulatory programs are observable. The measurement of transcriptome-wide gene expression has convincingly switched from microarrays to sequencing in a matter of years. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a quantitative and open system for profiling transcriptional outcomes on a large scale and therefore facilitates a large diversity of applications, including basic science studies, but also agricultural or clinical situations. In the past 10 years or so, much has been learned about the characteristics of the RNA-seq datasets as well as the performance of the myriad of methods developed. In this review, we give an overall view of the developments in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, with an explicit focus on quantification of gene expression and statistical approaches for differential expression. We also highlight emerging data types, such as single-cell RNA-seq and gene expression profiling using long-read technologies.},

Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches.

The functions of most circRNAs remain largely unexplored, but known functions include sequestration of microRNAs or proteins, modulation of transcription and interference with splicing, and even translation to produce polypeptides. However, challenges exist at multiple levels to understanding of the regulation of circRNAs because of their circular conformation and sequence overlap with linear mRNA counterparts.

	abstract = {Background
While RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming a powerful technology in transcriptome profiling, one significant shortcoming of the first-generation RNA-seq protocol is that it does not retain the strand specificity of origin for each transcript. Without strand information it is difficult and sometimes impossible to accurately quantify gene expression levels for genes with overlapping genomic loci that are transcribed from opposite strands. It has recently become possible to retain the strand information by modifying the RNA-seq protocol, known as strand-specific or stranded RNA-seq. Here, we evaluated the advantages of stranded RNA-seq in transcriptome profiling of whole blood RNA samples compared with non-stranded RNA-seq, and investigated the influence of gene overlaps on gene expression profiling results based on practical RNA-seq datasets and also from a theoretical perspective.

Results
Our results demonstrated a substantial impact of stranded RNA-seq on transcriptome profiling and gene expression measurements. As many as 1751 genes in Gencode Release 19 were identified to be differentially expressed when comparing stranded and non-stranded RNA-seq whole blood samples. Antisense and pseudogenes were significantly enriched in differential expression analyses. Because stranded RNA-seq retains strand information of a read, we can resolve read ambiguity in overlapping genes transcribed from opposite strands, which provides a more accurate quantification of gene expression levels compared with traditional non-stranded RNA-seq. In the human genome, it is not uncommon to find genomic loci where both strands encode distinct genes. Among the over 57,800 annotated genes in Gencode release 19, there are an estimated 19 \% (about 11,000) of overlapping genes transcribed from the opposite strands. Based on our whole blood mRNA-seq datasets, the fraction of overlapping nucleotide bases on the same and opposite strands were estimated at 2.94 \% and 3.1 \%, respectively. The corresponding theoretical estimations are 3 \% and 3.6 \%, well in agreement with our own findings.

Conclusions
Stranded RNA-seq provides a more accurate estimate of transcript expression compared with non-stranded RNA-seq, and is therefore the recommended RNA-seq approach for future mRNA-seq studies.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of animal RNAs. To investigate possible circRNA functions, it is important to understand circRNA biogenesis. Besides human ALU repeats, sequence features that promote exon circularization are largely unknown. We experimentally identified circRNAs in C. elegans. Reverse complementary sequences between introns bracketing circRNAs were significantly enriched in comparison to linear controls. By scoring the presence of reverse complementary sequences in human introns, we predicted and experimentally validated circRNAs. We show that introns bracketing circRNAs are highly enriched in RNA editing or hyperediting events. Knockdown of the double-strand RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 significantly and specifically upregulated circRNA expression. Together, our data support a model of animal circRNA biogenesis in which competing RNA-RNA interactions of introns form larger structures that promote circularization of embedded exons, whereas ADAR1 antagonizes circRNA expression by melting stems within these interactions.},

	abstract = {For several decades, cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death throughout all countries. There is a strong genetic component to many disease subtypes (e.g., cardiomyopathy) and we are just beginning to understand the relevant genetic factors. Several studies have related RNA splicing to cardiovascular disease and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an emerging player. circRNAs, which originate through back-splicing events from primary transcripts, are resistant to exonucleases and typically not polyadenylated. Initial functional studies show clear phenotypic outcomes for selected circRNAs. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive catalogue of RNase R-resistant circRNA species for the adult murine heart. This work combines state-of-the-art circle sequencing with our novel DCC software to explore the circRNA landscape of heart tissue. Overall, we identified 575 circRNA species that pass a beta-binomial test for enrichment (false discovery rate of 1\%) in the exonuclease-treated sequencing sample. Several circRNAs can be directly attributed to host genes that have been previously described as associated with cardiovascular disease. Further studies of these candidate circRNAs may reveal disease-relevant properties or functions of specific circRNAs.},

Multiple reports have also indicated the ability of miRNAs to target protein-coding sequences (CDS); however, miRNAs have been generally believed to function through similar mechanisms regardless of the locations of their sites of action. Here, we report a class of miRNA-recognition elements (MREs) that function exclusively in CDS regions. Through functional and mechanistic characterization of these 'unusual' MREs, we demonstrate that CDS-targeted miRNAs require extensive base-pairing at the 3' side rather than the 5' seed; cause gene silencing in an Argonaute-dependent but GW182-independent manner; and repress translation by inducing transient ribosome stalling instead of mRNA destabilization. These findings reveal distinct mechanisms and functional consequences of miRNAs that target CDS versus the 3' UTR and suggest that CDS-targeted miRNAs may use a translational quality-control-related mechanism to regulate translation in mammalian cells.},

Many tools are able to ﬁnd sequence motifs from lists of target RNAs, while others focus on structure using different approaches to ﬁnd speciﬁc interaction elements. In this work, we make a systematic analysis of RBP–RNA and RNA–RNA datasets to better characterize the interaction landscape with information about multi-motifs on the same RNAs. To achieve this goal, we updated our BEAM algorithm to combine both sequence and structure information to create pairs of patterns that model motifs of interaction. This algorithm was applied to several RNA binding proteins and ncRNAs interactors, conﬁrming already known motifs and discovering new ones. This landscape analysis on interaction variability reﬂects the diversity of target recognition and underlines that often both primary and secondary structure are involved in molecular recognition.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases., Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The accuracy of transcript quantification using RNA-seq data depends on many factors, such as the choice of alignment or mapping method and the quantification model being adopted. While the choice of quantification model has been shown to be important, considerably less attention has been given to comparing the effect of various read alignment approaches on quantification accuracy. We investigate the effect of mapping and alignment on the accuracy of transcript quantification in both simulated and experimental data, as well as the effect on subsequent differential gene expression analysis. We observe that, even when the quantification model itself is held fixed, the effect of choosing a different alignment methodology, or aligning reads using different parameters, on quantification estimates can sometimes be large, and can affect downstream analyses as well. These effects can go unnoticed when assessment is focused too heavily on simulated data, where the alignment task is often simpler than in experimentally-acquired samples. We discuss best practices regarding alignment for the purposes of quantification, and also introduce a new hybrid alignment methodology, called selective alignment (SA), to overcome the shortcomings of lightweight approaches without incurring the computational cost of traditional alignment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a recently re-discovered species of RNA that emerge during RNA maturation through a process called back-splicing. A downstream 5′ splice site is linked to an upstream 3′ splice site to form a circular transcript instead of a canonical linear transcript. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have brought circRNAs back into the focus of many scientists. Since then, several studies reported that circRNAs are differentially expressed across tissue types and developmental stages, implying that they are actively regulated and not merely a by-product of splicing. Though functional studies have shown that some circRNAs could act as miRNA-sponges, the function of most circRNAs remains unknown. To expand our understanding of possible roles of circular RNAs, we propose a new pipeline that could fully characterizes candidate circRNA structure from RNAseq data—FUCHS: FUll CHaracterization of circular RNA using RNA-Sequencing. Currently, most computational prediction pipelines use back-spliced reads to identify circular RNAs. FUCHS extends this concept by considering all RNA-seq information from long reads (typically {\textgreater}150 bp) to learn more about the exon coverage, the number of double break point fragments, the different circular isoforms arising from one host-gene, and the alternatively spliced exons within the same circRNA boundaries. This new knowledge will enable the user to carry out differential motif enrichment and miRNA seed analysis to determine potential regulators during circRNA biogenesis. FUCHS is an easy-to-use Python based pipeline that contributes a new aspect to the circRNA research.},

We found that a human circRNA, antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as), is densely bound by microRNA (miRNA) effector complexes and harbours 63 conserved binding sites for the ancient miRNA miR-7. Further analyses indicated that CDR1as functions to bind miR-7 in neuronal tissues. Human CDR1as expression in zebrafish impaired midbrain development, similar to knocking down miR-7, suggesting that CDR1as is a miRNA antagonist with a miRNA-binding capacity ten times higher than any other known transcript.

	abstract = {Background
Acutely stressful experiences can trigger neuropsychiatric disorders and impair cognitive processes by altering hippocampal function. Although the intrinsic organization of the hippocampus is highly conserved throughout its long dorsal-ventral axis, the dorsal (anterior) hippocampus mediates spatial navigation and memory formation, whereas the ventral (posterior) hippocampus is involved in emotion regulation. To understand the molecular consequences of stress, detailed genome-wide screens are necessary and need to distinguish between dorsal and ventral hippocampal regions. While transcriptomic screens have become a mainstay in basic and clinical research, proteomic methods are rapidly evolving and hold even greater promise to reveal biologically and clinically relevant biomarkers.
Methods
Here, we provide the first combined transcriptomic (RNA sequencing) and proteomic (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra [SWATH-MS]) profiling of dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. We used three different acute stressors (novelty, swim, and restraint) to assess the impact of stress on both regions.
Results
We demonstrated that both hippocampal regions display radically distinct molecular responses and that the ventral hippocampus is particularly sensitive to the effects of stress. Separately analyzing these structures greatly increased the sensitivity to detect stress-induced changes. For example, protein interaction cluster analyses revealed a stress-responsive epigenetic network around histone demethylase Kdm6b restricted to the ventral hippocampus, and acute stress reduced methylation of its enzymatic target H3K27me3. Selective Kdm6b knockdown in the ventral hippocampus led to behavioral hyperactivity/hyperresponsiveness.
Conclusions
These findings underscore the importance of considering dorsal and ventral hippocampus separately when conducting high-throughput molecular analyses, which has important implications for fundamental research as well as clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Available methods for differentiating human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) into neurons are often cumbersome, slow, and variable. Alternatively, human fibroblasts can be directly converted into induced neuronal (iN) cells. However, with present techniques conversion is inefficient, synapse formation is limited, and only small amounts of neurons can be generated. Here, we show that human ESCs and iPSCs can be converted into functional iN cells with nearly 100\% yield and purity in less than 2 weeks by forced expression of a single transcription factor. The resulting ES-iN or iPS-iN cells exhibit quantitatively reproducible properties independent of the cell line of origin, form mature pre- and postsynaptic specializations, and integrate into existing synaptic networks when transplanted into mouse brain. As illustrated by selected examples, our approach enables large-scale studies of human neurons for questions such as analyses of human diseases, examination of human-specific genes, and drug screening.},

	abstract = {Transcription factor programming of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has emerged as an approach to generate human neurons for disease modeling. However, programming schemes produce a variety of cell types, and those neurons that are made often retain an immature phenotype, which limits their utility in modeling neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission. We report that combining NGN2 programming with SMAD and WNT inhibition generates human patterned induced neurons (hpiNs). Single-cell analyses showed that hpiN cultures contained cells along a developmental continuum, ranging from poorly differentiated neuronal progenitors to well-differentiated, excitatory glutamatergic neurons. The most differentiated neurons could be identified using a CAMK2A::GFP reporter gene and exhibited greater functionality, including NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We conclude that utilizing single-cell and reporter gene approaches for selecting successfully programmed cells for study will greatly enhance the utility of hpiNs and other programmed neuronal populations in the modeling of nervous system disorders.},

	abstract = {Circular RNA (circRNA) is mainly generated by the splice donor of a downstream exon joining to an upstream splice acceptor, a phenomenon known as backsplicing. It has been reported that circRNA can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, transcriptional regulators, or potential biomarkers. The availability of massive non-polyadenylated transcriptomes data has facilitated the genome-wide identification of thousands of circRNAs. Several circRNA detection tools or pipelines have recently been developed, and it is essential to provide useful guidelines on these pipelines for users, including a comprehensive and unbiased comparison. Here, we provide an improved and easy-to-use circRNA read simulator that can produce mimicking backsplicing reads supporting circRNAs deposited in CircBase. Moreover, we compared the performance of 11 circRNA detection tools on both simulated and real datasets. We assessed their performance regarding metrics such as precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and Area under Curve. It is concluded that no single method dominated on all of these metrics. Among all of the state-of-the-art tools, CIRI, CIRCexplorer, and KNIFE, which achieved better balanced performance between their precision and sensitivity, compared favorably to the other methods.},

Drawing from a historical parallel with Victorian antivivisectionism, we highlight important threads in our case studies that mark the often neglected specificities of debates on animal experimentation. From the representation of the sadistic scientist in the XIX century, to his/her claimed capture by vested interests and evasion of public scrutiny in the contemporary cases, we show that animals are not simply the focus of the debate, but also a privileged locus at which much broader issues are being raised about science, its authority, accountability and potential misalignment with public interest. By highlighting this common socio-political conflict underlying public controversies around animal experimentation, our work prompts the exploration of modes of authority and argumentation that, in establishing the usefulness of animals in science, avoid reenacting the traditional divide between epistemic and political fora.},

	abstract = {In its last round of publications in September 2012, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) assigned a biochemical function to most of the human genome, which was taken up by the media as meaning the end of ‘Junk DNA’. This provoked a heated reaction from evolutionary biologists, who among other things claimed that ENCODE adopted a wrong and much too inclusive notion of function, making its dismissal of junk DNA merely rhetorical. We argue that this criticism rests on misunderstandings concerning the nature of the ENCODE project, the relevant notion of function and the claim that most of our genome is junk. We argue that evolutionary accounts of function presuppose functions as ‘causal roles’, and that selection is but a useful proxy for relevant functions, which might well be unsuitable to biomedical research. Taking a closer look at the discovery process in which ENCODE participates, we argue that ENCODE’s strategy of biochemical signatures successfully identified activities of DNA elements with an eye towards causal roles of interest to biomedical research. We argue that ENCODE’s controversial claim of functionality should be interpreted as saying that 80 \% of the genome is engaging in relevant biochemical activities and is very likely to have a causal role in phenomena deemed relevant to biomedical research. Finally, we discuss ambiguities in the meaning of junk DNA and in one of the main arguments raised for its prevalence, and we evaluate the impact of ENCODE’s results on the claim that most of our genome is junk.},

	abstract = {Non-coding RNA is an interesting class of gene regulators with diverse functionalities. One large subgroup of non-coding RNAs is the recently discovered class of circular RNAs (circRNAs). CircRNAs are conserved and expressed in a tissue and developmental specific manner, although for the vast majority, the functional relevance remains unclear. To identify and quantify circRNAs expression, several bioinformatic pipelines have been developed to assess the catalogue of circRNAs in any given total RNA sequencing dataset. We recently compared five different algorithms for circRNA detection, but here this analysis is extended to 11 algorithms. By comparing the number of circRNAs discovered and their respective sensitivity to RNaseR digestion, the sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm are evaluated. Moreover, the ability to predict de novo circRNA, i.e. circRNAs not derived from annotated splice sites, is also determined as well as the effect of eliminating low quality and adaptor-containing reads prior to circRNA prediction. Finally, and most importantly, all possible pair-wise combinations of algorithms are tested and guidelines for algorithm complementarity are provided. Conclusively, the algorithms mostly agree on highly expressed circRNAs, however, in many cases, algorithm-specific false positives with high read counts are predicted, which is resolved by using the shared output from two (or more) algorithms.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate most human messenger RNAs and play essential roles in diverse developmental and physiological processes. Correctly predicting the function of each miRNA requires a better understanding of miRNA targeting efficacy. McGeary et al. measured binding affinities between six miRNAs and synthetic targets, built a biochemical model of miRNA-mediated repression, and expanded it to all miRNAs using a convolutional neural network. This approach offers insights into miRNA targeting and enables more accurate prediction of intracellular miRNA repression efficacy than previous algorithms.
Science, this issue p. eaav1741
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that guide repression of mRNA targets. Each miRNA associates with an Argonaute (AGO) protein to form a complex in which the miRNA recognizes mRNA targets, primarily through pairing to sites that match its extended seed region (miRNA nucleotides 1 to 8) while the AGO protein recruits factors that promote destabilization and translational repression of bound targets. The miRNA targetome is vast, involving most mammalian mRNAs, and miRNA regulatory effects are consequential, with severe developmental or physiological defects often observed after deleting a broadly conserved miRNA (or set of paralogous miRNAs). Deeper understanding of these regulatory roles would be facilitated by a better understanding of miRNA targeting efficacy.
RATIONALEIn principle, targeting efficacy should be a function of the affinity between AGO-miRNA complexes and their target sites, in that greater affinity for a target site would cause increased occupancy at that site and thus increased repression of the target mRNA. However, the set of measured miRNA-target binding affinities has been sparse, and standard thermodynamic models of RNA-RNA pairing poorly predict affinities that have been measured. These limitations have prevented construction of an informative biochemical model of targeting efficacy, such that the best predictive performances have instead relied on indirect, correlative approaches. Here, we adapted RNA bind-n-seq (RBNS) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to study miRNA-target interactions, thereby obtaining the quantity and diversity of affinity values needed to better understand and predict miRNA targeting efficacy.
RESULTSAnalysis of motifs enriched in RNA sequences bound to the AGO2–miR-1 complex provided unbiased identification of all miR-1 binding sites ≤12 nucleotides (nt) in length, and a newly developed computational procedure simultaneously inferred the relative dissociation constants (Kd values) of all of these sites. Repeating this procedure with AGO2 loaded with five other miRNAs (let-7a, miR-7, miR-124, miR-155, and lsy-6) revealed pronounced miRNA-specific differences in the relative affinities of canonical site types (defined as sites with ≥6-nt contiguous matches to the seed region). The analyses also revealed that each miRNA has a distinct repertoire of noncanonical site types and that dinucleotides flanking both sides of each site influence affinity by as much as 100-fold, primarily because of their impact on site accessibility. Most of the noncanonical sites paired to the seed region but did so with imperfections that reduced affinity to levels below those of the top four canonical sites. Nonetheless, for miR-124 and miR-155, noncanonical sites were identified with affinities approaching that of the top canonical site. These high-affinity noncanonical sites were larger and correspondingly rarer in mRNA sequences, which showed that canonical seed pairing is the most efficient way to achieve high-affinity binding.The miRNA-specific differences in site repertoire and relative binding affinities corresponded to differential repression in cells, thereby enabling construction of a biochemical model of miRNA-mediated repression. This biochemical model predicts the occupancy at each site as a function of the Kd measured for the 12-nt sequence encompassing the site. The model outperformed the best correlative model, explaining {\textasciitilde}60\% of the relevant variation observed after transfecting a miRNA into cells. Although partly attributable to inclusion of noncanonical sites, the improved performance was primarily due to more accurate representation of the effects of canonical sites. Improved performance was extended to miRNAs without RBNS data by building a CNN that was trained with both RBNS-derived Kd values and mRNA-transfection fold-change measurements to predict binding affinity between any miRNA and any 12-nt sequence.
CONCLUSIONWe replaced correlative models of targeting efficacy with a principled, biochemical model that explains and predicts about half of the variability attributable to the direct effects of miRNAs on their targets. The success of the model shows that site binding affinity is the major determinant of miRNA-mediated repression. It also shows that although active AGO-miRNA complexes are occupied primarily by canonical sites, noncanonical sites measurably contribute to repression in the cell. Repression efficacy predicted by this model will be available on the TargetScan website to provide improved guidance for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6472/eaav1741/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Biochemical modeling of targeting efficacy.RBNS generates relative Kd values for an AGO-miRNA and 262,144 different 12-nt sequences with at least a weak match to the miRNA (left).

GODFREY/WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act within Argonaute proteins to guide repression of messenger RNA targets. Although various approaches have provided insight into target recognition, the sparsity of miRNA-target affinity measurements has limited understanding and prediction of targeting efficacy. Here, we adapted RNA bind-n-seq to enable measurement of relative binding affinities between Argonaute-miRNA complexes and all sequences ≤12 nucleotides in length. This approach revealed noncanonical target sites specific to each miRNA, miRNA-specific differences in canonical target-site affinities, and a 100-fold impact of dinucleotides flanking each site. These data enabled construction of a biochemical model of miRNA-mediated repression, which was extended to all miRNA sequences using a convolutional neural network. This model substantially improved prediction of cellular repression, thereby providing a biochemical basis for quantitatively integrating miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.
Millions of affinity measurements reveal microRNA-specific preferences and other insights that advance microRNA target prediction.

The seed sequence of miRNAs is the key determinant for target site recognition. Paralogous miRNAs, which share the same seed sequences but differ in their 3′ regions, are known to regulate largely overlapping groups of mRNAs. However, no study has analyzed functional differences between paralogous miRNAs with proper experimental methods. In this study, we compared the targets of paralogous miRNAs, miR-221 and miR-222. Using a nuclease-mediated genome engineering technique, we established knockout cell lines for these miRNAs, and precisely analyzed differences in target regulation. We found that miR-221 and miR-222 suppress the previously identified targets, CDKN1B and CDKN1C, differentially. Whereas both miRNAs suppressed CDKN1B, only miR-221 suppressed CDKN1C. From transcriptome analyses, we found that several different target mRNAs were regulated by each of miR-221 and miR-222 independently, although a large number of mRNAs responded commonly to miR-221 and miR-222. This is the first study to compare the mRNA regulations by paralogous miRNAs and illustrate that paralogous miRNAs with the same seed sequence also have difference in target regulation.},

Genetic perturbations revealed a functional overlap in neuronal differentiation for the cotargeting pair miR-138/miR-137. Clustering of all cotargeting pairs revealed a group of nine predominantly brain-enriched miRNAs that share many targets.

	abstract = {Autism is known as a severe neurobehavioral syndrome, with males affected more often than females. Previous studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the search for novel therapeutic strategies for autism. Therefore, we evaluate the ability of miR-153 to influence brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) of autism as well as proliferation and apoptosis of hippocampal neuron through the janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway by targeting leptin receptor (LEPR). Firstly, the autistic mice models were established and Morris water maze was employed for the analysis of the learning ability and memory of the mice. Besides, in vitro experiments were conducted with the transfection of different mimic, inhibitor, or siRNA into the hippocampal neuron cells, after which the effect of miR-153 on LEPR and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway-related factors was investigated. Next, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry assay were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis respectively following transfection. The results revealed that there was a significant decrease in learning ability and memory in the autistic mice along with a reduction in the positive expression rate of BDNF and serious inflammatory reaction. LEPR was confirmed as a target gene of miR-153 by the dual luciferase reporter gene assay. After transfection of overexpressed miR-153, LEPR and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway were inhibited followed by an increase in BDNF and enhancement of cell proliferation. In conclusion, the high expression of miR-153 can inhibit activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway by LEPR, thus improving BDNF expression and the proliferative ability of hippocampal neurons.},

However, the regulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus requires further study. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-153 (miR-153), a highly conserved microRNA in mice and humans, in adult neurogenesis. During the passaging of neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro, endogenous miR-153 expression was downregulated, with a decrease in neuronal differentiation ability. In addition, miR-153 overexpression increased the neurogenesis of NSCs. Further studies showed that miR-153 regulated neurogenesis by precisely targeting the Notch signaling pathway through inhibition of Jagged1 and Hey2 translation. In vivo analysis demonstrated that miR-153 expression was decreased in the hippocampi of aged mice with impaired cognitive ability, and that miR-153 overexpression in the hippocampus promoted neurogenesis and markedly increased the cognitive abilities of the aged mice. Overall, our findings revealed that miR-153 affected neurogenesis by regulating the Notch signaling pathway and elucidated the function of miR-153 in aging-related, hippocampus-dependent cognitive ability impairments, and neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Dysregulation of human alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) is one of the major contributors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is well known neurotoxin which increases α-SYN expression and causes dopaminergic neuronal death. Increasing evidence suggests microRNAs (miRNAs), especially miRNA-7 and miR-153, have important role in the regulation of α-SYN translation and they can prevent MPP+-mediated neuronal death. Here, we examined whether MPP+-mediated upregulation of α-SYN expression is directly related to miRNA-7 and miR-153. First, we established HEK293/TR cells stably expressing both miR-7 and miR-153. Human α-SYN 3′-UTR containing target sites for both miRNAs was cloned next to a luciferase reporter construct. To control the total levels of reporter mRNA, a tetracycline-inducible system was used. Compared to wild-type HEK293/TR cells, cells overexpressing both miRNAs demonstrated about 75\% reduction in luciferase activity. MPP+ treatment, however, significantly increased luciferase activity of human α-SYN 3′-UTR. Either quenching mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) or translational inhibition significantly reduced MPP+-mediated luciferase activity, suggesting mitochondrial ROS is responsible for MPP+-induced α-SYN translation. Together, our results suggest that MPP+-mediated increased α-SYN levels are contributed by mitochondrial ROS-mediated de novo protein synthesis which is regulated by miRNA-7 and miR-153.},

	abstract = {Genetic and biochemical studies have established a central role for α-synuclein accumulation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Here, two microRNAs, namely mir-7 and mir-153, have been identified to regulate α-synuclein levels post-transcriptionally. These microRNAs bind specifically to the 3′-untranslated region of α-synuclein and down-regulate its mRNA and protein levels, with their effect being additive. They are expressed predominantly in the brain with a pattern that mirrors synuclein expression in different tissues as well as during neuronal development, indicating that they play a tuning role in the amount of α-synuclein produced. Overexpression of mir-7 and mir-153 significantly reduces endogenous α-synuclein levels, whereas inhibition of mir-7 and mir-153 enhances translation of a luciferase construct bearing the α-synuclein 3′-untranslated region in primary neurons. These findings reveal a significant additional mechanism by which α-synuclein is regulated and point toward new therapeutic regimes for lowering endogenous α-synuclein levels in patients with familial or sporadic Parkinson disease.},

Loss of miR-153 causes overexpression of SNAP-25 and consequent hyperactive movement in early zebrafish embryos. Conversely, overexpression of miR-153 causes SNAP-25 down regulation resulting in near complete paralysis, mimicking the effects of treatment with Botulinum neurotoxin. miR-153-dependent changes in synaptic activity at the neuromuscular junction are consistent with the observed movement defects. Underlying the movement defects, perturbation of miR-153 function causes dramatic developmental changes in motor neuron patterning and branching.

To explore the link between the birth of ancient microRNAs and body plan evolution, we set out to determine the ancient sites of activity of conserved bilaterian microRNA families in a comparative approach. We reason that any specific localization shared between protostomes and deuterostomes (the two major superphyla of bilaterian animals) should probably reflect an ancient specificity of that microRNA in their last common ancestor. Here, we investigate the expression of conserved bilaterian microRNAs in Platynereis dumerilii, a protostome retaining ancestral bilaterian features,, in Capitella, another marine annelid, in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus, a deuterostome, and in sea anemone Nematostella, representing an outgroup to the bilaterians. Our comparative data indicate that the oldest known animal microRNA, miR-100, and the related miR-125 and let-7 were initially active in neurosecretory cells located around the mouth. Other sets of ancient microRNAs were first present in locomotor ciliated cells, specific brain centres, or, more broadly, one of four major organ systems: central nervous system, sensory tissue, musculature and gut. These findings reveal that microRNA evolution and the establishment of tissue identities were closely coupled in bilaterian evolution. Also, they outline a minimum set of cell types and tissues that existed in the protostome–deuterostome ancestor.},

	abstract = {Aberrant regulation of synaptic function is thought to play a role in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Normal neurotransmitter release is dependent on a complex group of presynaptic proteins that regulate synaptic vesicle docking, membrane fusion and fission, including synaptophysin, syntaxin, synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25), vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), α-synuclein and dynamin I. In addition, structural and signalling proteins such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) maintain the integrity of the synapse. We have assessed the levels of these important synaptic proteins using Western blots, in three cortical regions (BA10, 40 and 46) obtained post-mortem from subjects with bipolar 1 disorder, schizophrenia or no history of a psychiatric disorder. In bipolar 1 disorder cortex (parietal; BA40), we found a significant increase in the expression of SNAP-25, and a significant reduction in α-synuclein compared with controls. These changes in presynaptic protein expression are proposed to inhibit synaptic function in bipolar 1 disorder. In schizophrenia, a significant reduction in the ratio of the two major membrane-bound forms of NCAM (180 and 140) was observed in BA10. The distinct functions of these two NCAM forms suggest that changes in the comparative levels of these proteins could lead to a destabilisation of synaptic signalling. Our data support the notion that there are complex and region-specific alterations in presynaptic proteins that may lead to alterations in synaptic activity in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.},

	abstract = {Background
Several evidences suggest that failure of synaptic function occurs at preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) preceding neuronal loss and the classical AD pathological hallmarks. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to identify reliable biomarkers that could be obtained with non-invasive methods to improve AD diagnosis at early stages. Here, we have examined plasma levels of a group of miRNAs related to synaptic proteins in a cohort composed of cognitive healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects.

Methods
Plasma and brain levels of miRNAs were analysed in two different cohorts including 38 HC, 26 MCI, 56 AD dementia patients and 27 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. D’Agostino and Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to evaluate data normality. miRNA levels between groups were compared using a two-sided nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and sensitivity and specificity was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results
Significant upregulation of miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p and miR-210-3p was found in the plasma of both MCI and AD subjects. MCI patients that progress to AD showed higher plasma levels of these miRNAs. By contrast, no changes in miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p or miR-210-3p levels were observed in plasma obtained from a cohort of FTD.

Conclusion
Our study shows that plasma miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p and miR-210-3p constitute a specific molecular signature potentially useful as a potential biomarker for AD.

Conversely, miR-210 knockdown promotes an increase in the radial glial cell population and delayed differentiation, resulting in an increase in late-born postmitotic neurons. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK7 is regulated by miR-210 and is necessary for normal NP cell-cycle progression.

	abstract = {Vascular dementia (VD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly people. However, little is understood about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in cognitive impairment in early VD. Here, a VD model induced by chronic cerebral ischemia and fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free cell model that detects synapse formation was established to investigate the function of miRNAs in early VD. The microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that miR-210-5p increased significantly in the hippocampus of rats with 4 weeks of ischemia. The VD model rats also displayed significant cognitive deficits and synaptic loss. The overexpression of miR-210-5p decreased the synaptic number in primary hippocampal neurons, whereas specific suppression of miR-210-5p resulted in the formation of more synapses. Additionally, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of miR-210-5p agomir to VD rats aggravated phenotypes of cognitive impairment and synaptic loss. These VD-induced phenotypes were effectively attenuated by miR-210-5p antagomir. Moreover, bioinformatic prediction revealed that synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 KDa (Snap25) mRNA is targeted by miR-210-5p. The miR-210-5p decreased the luciferase activities of 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of Snap25 mRNA. Mutation of predicted miR-210-5p binding sites in the 3’ UTR of Snap25 mRNA abolished the miR-210-5p-induced decrease in luciferase activity. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining confirmed that miR-210-5p targets Snap25. Finally, RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining detected that miR-210-5p agomir downregulated Snap25 expression in the cornu ammonis1 (CA1) region of hippocampi in VD rats, whereas miR-210-5p antagomir upregulated Snap25 expression. Altogether, miR-210-5p contributes to cognitive impairment in chronic ischemia-induced VD model through the regulation of Snap25 expression, which potentially provides an opportunity to develop a new therapeutic strategy for VD.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of ∼22-nucleotide (nt) noncoding RNAs, some of which are known to control the expression of other genes at the posttranscriptional level ([1–4][1]). We developed a computational procedure (MiRscan) to identify miRNA genes ([5][2]) and apply it here to identify most of the miRNA genes in vertebrates. MiRscan relies on the observation that the known miRNAs derive from phylogenetically conserved stem loop precursor RNAs with characteristic features. MiRscan evaluates conserved stem loops as miRNA precursors by passing a 21-nt window along each conserved stem loop, assigning a log-likelihood score to each window that measures how well its attributes resemble those of the first 50 experimentally verified C. elegans miRNAs with C. briggsae homologs ([2][3], [3][4], [5][2]).

Folding of aligned regions of the human and mouse genomes, with subsequent comparison to the pufferfish Fugu rubripes genome, identified ∼15,000 human genomic segments that fell out-side of predicted protein coding genes, were predicted to form stem loops, and were at least loosely conserved among the three vertebrate species ([6][5]). MiRscan evaluation revealed a high-scoring set of 188 human loci, using a natural cutoff score of 10, defined by a dip in the distribution at this point ([Fig. 1][6]). This set included 81 of the 109 members of a reference set of known human miRNA loci, for a sensitivity of 0.74. The fact that a procedure developed and trained solely using nematode miRNAs could also identify most of the vertebrate miRNAs shows that the generic features of the miRNAs and their precursors are conserved broadly among diverse animals, even though the sequences of most miRNAs are not as broadly conserved.

Computational identification of vertebrate miRNA genes ([6][5]). The histogram represents the distribution of MiRscan scores for 15,133 human/ Fugu consensus structures. Of the 109 reference-set loci, 91 were retained among these aligned segments (red), indicating that at least 80\% of the human miRNAs are conserved in fish. The distribution peaks at the score of –4, with a count of 1198, but is truncated at a score of –4 and count of 200 to increase resolution at the high-scoring tail of the distribution. The 188 candidates with scores greater than 10.0 were examined further (expanded portion of the histogram): 81 were in the reference set of known loci (red), 14 were close paralogs of loci in the reference set (≤2 point substitutions within the miRNA) or represented cloned human miRNAs for which loci had not been previously reported (pink), and 38 were found in miRNA cDNA libraries made from zebrafish (purple) ([6][5]).



Our analysis can be used to calculate an upper bound on the number of human miRNA genes. If all 188 candidates were authentic miRNA genes and these represented 74\% of the total miRNA genes, then there are no more than 255 miRNA genes in the genome. Note that this calculation assumes that rare miRNAs—those expressed at low levels or in a limited set of conditions or cell types, which would be underrepresented in our reference set of cloned miRNAs—will have a distribution of scores and degree of conservation similar to the cloned miRNAs. This assumption is supported by our finding that in nematodes, there is no correlation between the number of times an miRNA was cloned and its MiRscan score ([5][2]). Furthermore, a tissue such as mouse brain, which might be expected to have miRNAs unique to mammals, is not a particularly rich source of miRNAs without Fugu homologs ([7][8]).

The estimate of 255 human genes is an upper bound implying that no more than 40 miRNA genes remain to be identified in mammals [∼40 = ∼255 – (109 known genes + 107 new candidates)]. The estimates for both the gene total and genes remaining to be identified would be lower if some of the 107 newly identified gene candidates were false positives. To evaluate this possibility, we sought to verify these new candidates. Of the 107 new candidates, 14 were close paralogs of loci in the reference set or represented cloned human miRNAs for which loci had not been previously reported. Another 38 were detected in zebrafish cDNA libraries constructed specifically to contain miRNA and siRNA sequences ([6][5]). (Zebrafish was chosen for this analysis to facilitate examination of a diverse range of tissues and developmental stages.) This leaves 55 of the 188 candidates as either false positives or authentic miRNAs expressed at levels too low to be detected. Even if all 55 were false positives, the specificity of our computational procedure would be 133/188 (= 0.71), at a score cutoff that identifies 74\% of known loci. This minimum specificity value can be used to calculate a lower bound on the number of miRNA genes in mammals as (188 × 0.71)/0.74 = 180. When accounting for the sensitivity of our zebrafish experiments and the incomplete coverage of the genome assemblies used, the lower bound increases to about 200 genes ([6][5]).

The 200 to 255 miRNA genes represent nearly 1\% of the predicted genes in humans, a fraction similar to that seen for other very large gene families with regulatory roles, such as those encoding transcription-factor proteins. There is no indication that miRNAs are present in single-celled eukaryotes such as yeast. It is tempting to speculate that the substantial expansion of miRNA genes in plants and animals (and the apparent loss of miRNA genes in yeast) is related to their importance in specifying cell differentiation and developmental patterning.

	abstract = {MicroRNA targets are often recognized through pairing between the miRNA seed region and complementary sites within target mRNAs, but not all of these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005.001, Proteins are built by using the information contained in molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA). Cells have several ways of controlling the amounts of different proteins they make. For example, a so-called ‘microRNA’ molecule can bind to an mRNA molecule to cause it to be more rapidly degraded and less efficiently used, thereby reducing the amount of protein built from that mRNA. Indeed, microRNAs are thought to help control the amount of protein made from most human genes, and biologists are working to predict the amount of control imparted by each microRNA on each of its mRNA targets., All RNA molecules are made up of a sequence of bases, each commonly known by a single letter—‘A’, ‘U’, ‘C’ or ‘G’. These bases can each pair up with one specific other base—‘A’ pairs with ‘U’, and ‘C’ pairs with ‘G’. To direct the repression of an mRNA molecule, a region of the microRNA known as a ‘seed’ binds to a complementary sequence in the target mRNA. ‘Canonical sites’ are regions in the mRNA that contain the exact sequence of partner bases for the bases in the microRNA seed. Some canonical sites are more effective at mRNA control than others. ‘Non-canonical sites’ also exist in which the pairing between the microRNA seed and mRNA does not completely match. Previous work has suggested that many non-canonical sites can also control mRNA degradation and usage., Agarwal et al. first used large experimental datasets from many sources to investigate microRNA activity in more detail. As expected, when mRNAs had canonical sites that matched the microRNA, mRNA levels and usage tended to drop. However, no effect was observed when the mRNAs only had recently identified non-canonical sites. This suggests that microRNAs primarily bind to canonical sites to control protein production., Based on these results, Agarwal et al. further developed a statistical model that predicts the effects of microRNAs binding to canonical sites. The updated model considers 14 different features of the microRNA, microRNA site, or mRNA—including the mRNA sequence around the site—to predict which sites within mRNAs are most effectively targeted by microRNAs. Tests showed that Agarwal et al.'s model was as good as experimental approaches at identifying the effective target sites, and was better than existing computational models., The model has been used to power the latest version of a freely available resource called TargetScan, and so could prove a valuable resource for researchers investigating the many important roles of microRNAs in controlling protein production., DOI:

	abstract = {Accumulating studies have revealed that patients with psychiatric disorders have altered microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in the circulation and in relevant brain tissues. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that manipulating the levels of particular miRNAs in the brain can alter behaviour.The expression levels of some miRNAs change following certain behavioural or pharmacological challenges, thus facilitating a subsequent change in the expression of target genes, which are putatively needed in order to direct certain behavioural outcomes. It is also possible that miRNAs can serve as 'buffers' to keep levels of their protein targets stable and to avoid them being upregulated to pathological levels in response to a challenge.We discuss the pros and cons of the available molecular, biochemical, cellular and behavioural experimental approaches in both humans and rodents that are used for studying the role of miRNAs in psychiatric disorders. We also highlight example studies.We discuss future directions for studies examining the role of miRNAs in psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the importance of studies on both sexes, the need for utilizing proteomics analysis methods, the need for spatiotemporal expression maps of endogenous miRNAs in the developing and adult brain, and the need for testing miRNAs in specific cell types, circuits and subcellular fractions.Shedding light on the role of miRNAs in psychiatric disorders could lead to a better understanding of the molecular pathways that are disrupted in these disorders and possibly promote the much needed development of new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of deficits in social interaction, communication, and behavior. There is a significant genetic component to ASD, yet no single gene variant accounts for greater than one percent of incidence. Post-transcriptional mechanisms such as microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression without altering the genetic code. They are abundant in the developing brain and are dysregulated in children with ASD. Patterns of miRNA expression are altered in the brain, blood, saliva, and olfactory precursor cells of ASD subjects. The ability of miRNAs to regulate broad molecular pathways in response to environmental stimuli makes them an intriguing player in ASD, a disorder characterized by genetic predisposition with ill-defined environmental triggers. In addition, the availability and extracellular stability of miRNAs make them an ideal candidate for biomarker discovery. Here we discuss 27 miRNAs with overlap across ASD studies, including three miRNAs identified in 3 or more studies (miR-23a, miR-146a, and miR-106b). Together these 27 miRNAs have 1245 high-confidence mRNA targets, a significant number of which are expressed in the brain. Furthermore, these mRNA targets demonstrate over-representation of autism-related genes with enrichment of neurotrophic signaling molecules. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecule involved in hippocampal neurogenesis and altered in ASD, is targeted by 6 of the 27 miRNAs of interest. This neurotrophic pathway represents one intriguing mechanism by which perturbations in miRNA signaling might influence CNS development in children with ASD.},

	abstract = {Brain development is dependent on programmed gene expression, which is both genetically and epigenetically regulated. Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for brain development. As abnormal brain development is hypothesized to be associated with schizophrenia, miRNAs are an intriguing target for this disorder. The aims of this study were to determine the temporal dynamics of miRNA expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the relationship between miRNA’s temporal expression pattern and dysregulation in schizophrenia. This study used next-generation sequencing to characterize the temporal dynamics of miRNA expression in the DLPFC of 109 normal subjects (second trimester–74 years of age) and miRNA expression changes in 34 schizophrenia patients. Unlike mRNAs, the majority of which exhibits a wave of change in fetuses, most miRNAs are preferentially expressed during a certain period before puberty. It is noted that in schizophrenia patients, miRNAs normally enriched in infants tend to be upregulated, while those normally enriched in prepuberty tend to be downregulated, and the targets of these miRNAs are enriched for genes encoding synaptic proteins and those associated with schizophrenia. In addition, miR-936 and miR-3162 were found to be increased in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia. These findings reveal the temporal dynamics of miRNAs in the human DLPFC, implicate the importance of miRNAs in DLPFC development, and suggest a possible link between schizophrenia and dysregulation of miRNAs enriched in infancy and prepuberty.},

	abstract = {microRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, endogenously produced, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) of approximately 19–24 nucleotides (nts) in length known to exhibit gene silencing of complementary target sequence. Their deregulated expression is reported in various disease conditions and thus has therapeutic implications. In the last decade, various computational resources are published in this field. In this chapter, we have reviewed bioinformatics resources, i.e., miRNA-centered databases, algorithms, and tools to predict miRNA targets. First section has enlisted more than 75 databases, which mainly covers information regarding miRNA registries, targets, disease associations, differential expression, interactions with other noncoding RNAs, and all-in-one resources. In the algorithms section, we have compiled about 140 algorithms from eight subcategories, viz. for the prediction of precursor (pre-) and mature miRNAs. These algorithms are developed on various sequence, structure, and thermodynamic based features incorporated into different machine learning techniques (MLTs). In addition, computational identification of miRNAs from high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) data and their variants, viz. isomiRs, differential expression, miR-SNPs, and functional annotation, are discussed. Prediction and analysis of miRNAs and their associated targets are also evaluated under miR-targets section providing knowledge regarding novel miRNA targets and complex host-pathogen interactions. In conclusion, we have provided comprehensive review of in silico resources published in miRNA research to help scientific community be updated and choose the appropriate tool according to their needs.},

	abstract = {MicroRNA targets are often recognized through pairing between the miRNA seed region and complementary sites within target mRNAs, but not all of these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.
          , 
            Proteins are built by using the information contained in molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA). Cells have several ways of controlling the amounts of different proteins they make. For example, a so-called ‘microRNA’ molecule can bind to an mRNA molecule to cause it to be more rapidly degraded and less efficiently used, thereby reducing the amount of protein built from that mRNA. Indeed, microRNAs are thought to help control the amount of protein made from most human genes, and biologists are working to predict the amount of control imparted by each microRNA on each of its mRNA targets.
            All RNA molecules are made up of a sequence of bases, each commonly known by a single letter—‘A’, ‘U’, ‘C’ or ‘G’. These bases can each pair up with one specific other base—‘A’ pairs with ‘U’, and ‘C’ pairs with ‘G’. To direct the repression of an mRNA molecule, a region of the microRNA known as a ‘seed’ binds to a complementary sequence in the target mRNA. ‘Canonical sites’ are regions in the mRNA that contain the exact sequence of partner bases for the bases in the microRNA seed. Some canonical sites are more effective at mRNA control than others. ‘Non-canonical sites’ also exist in which the pairing between the microRNA seed and mRNA does not completely match. Previous work has suggested that many non-canonical sites can also control mRNA degradation and usage.
            Agarwal et al. first used large experimental datasets from many sources to investigate microRNA activity in more detail. As expected, when mRNAs had canonical sites that matched the microRNA, mRNA levels and usage tended to drop. However, no effect was observed when the mRNAs only had recently identified non-canonical sites. This suggests that microRNAs primarily bind to canonical sites to control protein production.
            Based on these results, Agarwal et al. further developed a statistical model that predicts the effects of microRNAs binding to canonical sites. The updated model considers 14 different features of the microRNA, microRNA site, or mRNA—including the mRNA sequence around the site—to predict which sites within mRNAs are most effectively targeted by microRNAs. Tests showed that Agarwal et al.'s model was as good as experimental approaches at identifying the effective target sites, and was better than existing computational models.
            The model has been used to power the latest version of a freely available resource called TargetScan, and so could prove a valuable resource for researchers investigating the many important roles of microRNAs in controlling protein production.},

On the other hand, most of the plant miRNAs studied so far direct the cleavage of their targets.The degree of complementarity between a miRNA and its target, at least in part, determines the regulatory mechanism.In animals, primary transcripts of miRNAs are processed sequentially by two RNase-III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, into a small, imperfect dsRNA duplex (miRNA:miRNA*) that contains both the mature miRNA strand and its complementary strand (miRNA*). Relative instability at the 5′ end of the mature miRNA leads to the asymmetric assembly of the mature miRNA into the effector complex, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).Ago proteins are a key component of the RISC. Multiple Ago homologues in various metazoan genomes indicate the existence of multiple RISCs that carry out related but specific biological functions.Bioinformatic prediction of miRNA targets has provided an important tool to explore the functions of miRNAs. However, the overall success rate of such predictions remains to be determined by experimental validation.},

Recently, it has been shown that pairs of miRNAs can repress the translation of a target mRNA in a cooperative manner, which leads to an enhanced effectiveness and specificity in target repression. However, it remains unclear which miRNA pairs can synergize and which genes are target of cooperative miRNA regulation. In this paper, we present a computational workflow for the prediction and analysis of cooperating miRNAs and their mutual target genes, which we refer to as RNA triplexes. The workflow integrates methods of miRNA target prediction; triplex structure analysis; molecular dynamics simulations and mathematical modeling for a reliable prediction of functional RNA triplexes and target repression efficiency. In a case study we analyzed the human genome and identified several thousand targets of cooperative gene regulation. Our results suggest that miRNA cooperativity is a frequent mechanism for an enhanced target repression by pairs of miRNAs facilitating distinctive and fine-tuned target gene expression patterns. Human RNA triplexes predicted and characterized in this study are organized in a web resource at www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/triplexrna/.},

Experimental data show that optimal down-regulation is obtained when two seed sites are separated by between 13 and 35 nt.

              By analyzing the signals from intronic probes of exon arrays, we performed, for the first time, genome-wide measurement of pre-mRNA expression dynamics.
            
            
              We discovered a striking lack of correspondence between mRNA and pre-mRNA temporal expression profiles following stimulus, demonstrating that measurement of mRNA dynamics does not suffice to infer transcript production profiles.
            
            
              By combining simultaneous measurement of pre-mRNA and mRNA profiles with a simple new quantitative theoretical description of transcription, we are able to infer complex time dependence of both transcript production and mRNA degradation.
            
            
              The production profiles of many transcripts reveal an operational strategy we termed Production Overshoot, which is used to accelerate mRNA response. The biological relevance of our findings was substantiated by observing similar results when studying the response of three different mammalian cell types to different stimuli.
            
          
        , Transcriptional responses to extracellular stimuli involve tuning the rates of transcript production and degradation. Here, we show that the time-dependent profiles of these rates can be inferred from simultaneous measurements of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) and mature mRNA profiles. Transcriptome-wide measurements demonstrate that genes with similar mRNA profiles often exhibit marked differences in the amplitude and onset of their production rate. The latter is characterized by a large dynamic range, with a group of genes exhibiting an unexpectedly strong transient production overshoot, thereby accelerating their induction and, when combined with time-dependent degradation, shaping transient responses with precise timing and amplitude.},

Recently, high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) has identified functional protein-RNA interaction sites. Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native Argonaute (Ago) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous datasets—Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites—that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNA-target mRNA interaction sites. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain.

To directly and unambiguously identify miRNA:target site interactions, we modified our CLIP methodology in C. elegans to experimentally ligate miRNAs to their target sites. Unexpectedly, ligation reactions also occurred in absence of the exogenous ligase. Our in vivo dataset and re-analysis of published mammalian AGO-CLIP data for miRNA-chimeras yielded {\textasciitilde}17,000 miRNA:target site interactions. Analysis of interactions and extensive experimental validation of chimera-discovered targets of viral miRNAs suggest that our strategy identifies canonical, noncanonical, and nonconserved miRNA interactions.

Novel snoRNA-rRNA hybrids were recovered between snR4-5S and U14-25S. These are supported by native electrophoresis and consistent with previously unexplained data. The U3 snoRNA was found to be associated with sequences close to the 3′ side of the central pseudoknot in 18S rRNA, supporting a role in formation of this structure. Applying CLASH to the yeast U2 spliceosomal snRNA led to a revised predicted secondary structure, featuring alternative folding of the 3′ domain and long-range contacts between the 3′ and 5′ domains. CLASH should allow transcriptome-wide analyses of RNA–RNA interactions in many organisms.},

Several target prediction tools are now available, which use distinct criteria and stringency to provide the best set of candidate targets for a single microRNA or a subset of microRNAs. However, there are many false-negative predictions, and consensus about the optimum strategy to select and use the output information provided by the target prediction tools is lacking. We compared the performance of four tools cited in literature—TargetScan, miRanda-mirSVR, Pita, and RNA22, and we determined the most effective approach for analyzing target prediction data (individual, union or intersection). For this purpose, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, and correlation of these approaches using 10 microRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-145-5p, and miR-155-5p) and 1,400 genes (700 validated and 700 non-validated) as targets of these microRNAs. The four tools provided a subset of high-quality predictions and returned few false-positive predictions; however, they could not identify several known true targets. We demonstrate that union of TargetScan/miRanda-mirSVR and TargetScan/miRanda-mirSVR/RNA22 enhanced the quality of in silico prediction analysis of microRNA targets. We conclude that the union rather than the intersection of the aforementioned tools is the best strategy for maximizing performance while minimizing the loss of time and resources in subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments for functional validation of microRNA-target interactions.},

	abstract = {lin-4 is essential for the normal temporal control of diverse postembryonic developmental events in C. elegans. lin-4 acts by negatively regulating the level of LIN-14 protein, creating a temporal decrease in LIN-14 protein starting in the first larval stage (L1). We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

Mutations in heterochronic genes cause temporal transformations in cell fates in which stage-specific events are omitted or reiterated2. Here we show that let-7 is a heterochronic switch gene. Loss of let-7 gene activity causes reiteration of larval cell fates during the adult stage, whereas increased let-7 gene dosage causes precocious expression of adult fates during larval stages.  let-7 encodes a temporally regulated 21-nucleotide RNA that is complementary to elements in the 3′ untranslated regions of the heterochronic genes  lin-14, lin-28, lin-41, lin-42 and daf-12, indicating that expression of these genes may be directly controlled by  let-7. A reporter gene bearing the lin-41 3′ untranslated region is temporally regulated in a let-7-dependent manner. A second regulatory RNA, lin-4, negatively regulates lin-14 and lin-28  through RNA–RNA interactions with their 3′ untranslated regions3,4.

We hypothesize that an intracellular pool of microRNAs/siRNAs faced with a larger number of available predicted target transcripts will downregulate each individual target gene to a lesser extent. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed mRNA expression change from 178 microRNA and siRNA transfection experiments in two cell lines. We find that downregulation of particular genes mediated by microRNAs and siRNAs indeed varies with the total concentration of available target transcripts. We conclude that to interpret and design experiments involving gene regulation by small RNAs, global properties, such as target mRNA abundance, need to be considered in addition to local determinants. We propose that analysis of microRNA/siRNA targeting would benefit from a more quantitative definition, rather than simple categorization of genes as ‘target' or ‘not a target.'

Termed ‘microRNA sponges’, these competitive inhibitors are transcripts expressed from strong promoters, containing multiple, tandem binding sites to a microRNA of interest. When vectors encoding these sponges are transiently transfected into cultured cells, sponges derepress microRNA targets at least as strongly as chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides.

	abstract = {Mirtrons are microRNA (miRNA) substrates that utilize the splicing machinery to bypass the necessity of Drosha cleavage for their biogenesis. Expanding our recent efforts for mammalian mirtron annotation, we use meta-analysis of aggregate datasets to identify {\textasciitilde}500 novel mouse and human introns that confidently generate diced small RNA duplexes. These comprise nearly 1000 total loci distributed in four splicing-mediated biogenesis subclasses, with 5'-tailed mirtrons as, by far, the dominant subtype. Thus, mirtrons surprisingly comprise a substantial fraction of endogenous Dicer substrates in mammalian genomes. Although mirtron-derived small RNAs exhibit overall expression correlation with their host mRNAs, we observe a subset with substantial differences that suggest regulated processing or accumulation. We identify characteristic sequence, length, and structural features of mirtron loci that distinguish them from bulk introns, and find that mirtrons preferentially emerge from genes with larger numbers of introns. While mirtrons generate miRNA-class regulatory RNAs, we also find that mirtrons exhibit many features that distinguish them from canonical miRNAs. We observe that conventional mirtron hairpins are substantially longer than Drosha-generated pre-miRNAs, indicating that the characteristic length of canonical pre-miRNAs is not a general feature of Dicer substrate hairpins. In addition, mammalian mirtrons exhibit unique patterns of ordered 5' and 3' heterogeneity, which reveal hidden complexity in miRNA processing pathways. These include broad 3'-uridylation of mirtron hairpins, atypically heterogeneous 5' termini that may result from exonucleolytic processing, and occasionally robust decapitation of the 5' guanine (G) of mirtron-5p species defined by splicing. Altogether, this study reveals that this extensive class of non-canonical miRNA bears a multitude of characteristic properties, many of which raise general mechanistic questions regarding the processing of endogenous hairpin transcripts., Bulk miRNAs in most animal cells derive from cleavage of hairpin precursor transcripts by the Drosha and Dicer RNase III enzymes. A variety of non-canonical miRNA biogenesis strategies are known, including "mirtrons" for which splicing substitutes for Drosha. However, as non-canonical miRNAs usually account for a minor fraction of total miRNA reads, the alternate pathways are often considered of minor impact. In this study, we describe meta-analysis of {\textgreater}1000 mouse and human small RNA datasets, and surprisingly, find evidence of nearly 1000 mirtron using stringent criteria, half of which were novel annotations. Therefore, mirtrons comprise a substantial fraction of total Dicer substrates. We use this catalog to perform diverse sequence and structural analyses of mirtron loci that differentiate them from bulk introns and also to perform diverse comparisons of mirtrons and canonical miRNAs. Surprisingly, we find that many seemingly fundamental features of miRNA genes, which have been well-studied over the years, are not actually general features of miRNAs, but specifically those of hairpins that transit the Drosha-Dicer pathway. Instead, the nearly 1000 splicing-derived miRNAs reveal expanded and/or distinct properties encompassed by endogenous Dicer substrates in mammalian cells. These features reveal hidden impacts that shape miRNA processing, function, and evolution.},

Here, we demonstrate that levels of the miR-183/96/182 cluster, miR-204, and miR-211 are regulated by different light levels in the mouse retina. Concentrations of these microRNAs were downregulated during dark adaptation and upregulated in light-adapted retinas, with rapid decay and increased transcription being responsible for the respective changes. We identified the voltage-dependent glutamate transporter Slc1a1 as one of the miR-183/96/182 targets in photoreceptor cells. We found that microRNAs in retinal neurons decay much faster than microRNAs in nonneuronal cells. The high turnover is also characteristic of microRNAs in hippocampal and cortical neurons, and neurons differentiated from ES cells in vitro. Blocking activity reduced turnover of microRNAs in neuronal cells while stimulation with glutamate accelerated it. Our results demonstrate that microRNA metabolism in neurons is higher than in most other cells types and linked to neuronal activity.

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) direct post-transcriptional regulation of human genes by guiding Argonaute proteins to complementary sites in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) targeted for repression. An enigmatic feature of many conserved mammalian miRNA target sites is that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 confers enhanced target repression independently of base pairing potential to the miRNA. In this study, we show that human Argonaute2 (Ago2) possesses a solvated surface pocket that specifically binds adenine nucleobases in the 1 position (t1) of target RNAs. t1A nucleotides are recognized indirectly through a hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules that preferentially interacts with the N6 amine on adenine. t1A nucleotides are not utilized during the initial binding of Ago2 to its target, but instead function by increasing the dwell time on target RNA. We also show that N6 adenosine methylation blocks t1A recognition, revealing a possible mechanism for modulation of miRNA target site potency., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07646.001, Stretches of DNA known as genes provide the instructions to make the proteins and RNA molecules a cell needs to work. To make a protein, the gene is used as a template to make a type of RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which is subsequently ‘translated’ into a protein. Most genes do not need to produce proteins all of the time, and so cells have several ways of stopping proteins from being made. For example, the Argonaute family of proteins prevents mRNA molecules from being translated into proteins., Argonautes are guided to their targets by short RNA molecules called microRNAs. RNA molecules are made up of a sequence of building blocks known as nucleotides, each of which can only bind to one other type of nucleotide. If part of the nucleotide sequence of a microRNA molecule corresponds with part of the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA, the two RNA molecules will bind to each other. This enables the microRNA and the Argonaute protein to prevent the mRNA being translated. If the mRNA has an adenine nucleotide in a particular position (called ‘t1’) near the binding region in the mRNA sequence, Argonaute proteins will prevent translation more effectively. An adenine nucleotide in the t1 position is also known as a t1A nucleotide., In 2014, researchers revealed the structure of a human Argonaute protein called Argonaute2 when it is bound to a microRNA-mRNA pair. This revealed that t1A nucleotides—but not other nucleotide types in the t1 position—interact with a ‘pocket’ in the Argonaute protein. However, it was not clear how the adenine nucleotide is recognized., Now, Schirle et al.—including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 work—use a technique called X-ray crystallography to examine how the t1A nucleotide interacts with Argonaute2 in more detail. This revealed that the Argonaute2 pocket contains many water molecules that form an organized network. This network interacts with part of the t1A nucleotide and helps to lock Argonaute2 onto its microRNA target sites. The discovery of the pocket and how t1A is recognized may now be used to design more effective ‘anti-miRs’—synthetic microRNA inhibitors that can treat diseases in which microRNAs work incorrectly, a feature common to many forms of cancer., DOI:

MicroRNAs are known to influence the evolution and stability of many mRNAs, but their global impact on protein output had not been examined. Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the response of thousands of proteins after introducing microRNAs into cultured cells and after deleting mir-223 in mouse neutrophils. The identities of the responsive proteins indicate that targeting is primarily through seed-matched sites located within favourable predicted contexts in 3′ untranslated regions. Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual microRNAs. Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable mRNA destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, mRNA destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression. The impact of microRNAs on the proteome indicated that for most interactions microRNAs act as rheostats to make fine-scale adjustments to protein output.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a large class of short noncoding RNAs found in many plants and animals, often act to post-transcriptionally inhibit gene expression. We report the generation of deletion mutations in 87 miRNA genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, expanding the number of mutated miRNA genes to 95, or 83\% of known C. elegans miRNAs. We find that the majority of miRNAs are not essential for the viability or development of C. elegans, and mutations in most miRNA genes do not result in grossly abnormal phenotypes. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that there is significant functional redundancy among miRNAs or among gene pathways regulated by miRNAs. This study represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis of miRNA function in any organism and provides a unique, permanent resource for the systematic study of miRNAs.},

We previously found that most C. elegans miRNAs are individually not essential for development or viability and proposed that paralogous miRNAs might often function redundantly [1]. To test this hypothesis, we generated mutant C. elegans strains that each lack multiple or all members of one of 15 miRNA families. Mutants for 12 of these families did not display strong synthetic abnormalities, suggesting that these miRNA families have subtle roles during development. By contrast, mutants deleted for all members of the mir-35 or mir-51 families died as embryos or early larvae, and mutants deleted for four members of the mir-58 family showed defects in locomotion, body size, and egg laying and an inability to form dauer larvae. Our findings indicate that the regulatory functions of most individual miRNAs and most individual families of miRNAs related in sequence are not critical for development or viability. Conversely, because in some cases miRNA family members act redundantly, our findings emphasize the importance of determining miRNA function in the absence of miRNAs related in sequence.},

Using in-depth phenotypic analyses of miRNA deletion mutant strains we reveal multiple developmental and post-developmental survival and behavioral functions for specific miRNAs during heat stress. We have identified additional functions for already known players (mir-71 and mir-239) as well as identifying mir-80 and the mir-229 mir-64-66 cluster as important regulators of the heat stress response in C. elegans. These findings uncover an additional layer of complexity to the regulation of stress signaling that enables animals to robustly respond to the changing environment.},

Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2–7), particularly those in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3′UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the “offset 6mer,” to be detected. In total, {\textgreater}45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3′UTRs are conserved above background levels, and {\textgreater}60\% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3′ end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (PCT) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3′-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the PCT for each site and each predicted target.},

We will then summarize studies performed with Dgcr8 knockout cell models with a focus on embryonic stem cells. After that, we will summarize results from various in vivo Dgcr8 knockout models. Given significant phenotypic differences in various tissues between Dgcr8 and Dicer knockout, we will also briefly review current progresses on understanding miRNA-independent functions of miRNA biogenesis factors. Finally, we will discuss the potential use of a new strategy to stably express miRNAs in Dgcr8 knockout cells.

However, G:U wobble base-pairing in this region interferes with activity beyond that predicted on the basis of thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, an mRNA can be simultaneously repressed by more than one miRNA species. The level of repression achieved is dependent on both the amount of mRNA and the amount of available miRNA complexes. Thus, predicted miRNA:mRNA interactions must be viewed in the context of other potential interactions and cellular conditions.},

However, the cause of the dramatic vulval rupturing phenotype of let-7 mutant C. elegans has remained unknown. Consistent with the notion that miRNAs function by coordinately tuning the expression of many targets, bursting may result from joint dysregulation of several targets, possibly in the epidermis. Alternatively, overexpression of LET-60/RAS, a key vulva development gene and a phylogenetically conserved target of let-7, may be responsible. Here, we show that let-7 functions in the vulval-uterine system to ensure vulval integrity but that regulation of most targets of let-7, including LET-60/RAS, is dispensable. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit endogenous let-7 target sites, we found that regulation of LIN-41/TRIM71 alone is necessary and sufficient to prevent vulval rupturing. Hence, let-7 does not function to reduce gene expression noise broadly, but to direct vulval development through extensive regulation of a single, defined target.},

Maternally contributed microRNAs may therefore play important roles in early development. We elucidated a major biological role of the nematode mir-35 family of maternally contributed essential microRNAs. We show that this microRNA family regulates the sex determination pathway at multiple levels, acting both upstream of and downstream from her-1 to prevent aberrantly activated male developmental programs in hermaphrodite embryos. Both of the predicted target genes that act downstream from the mir-35 family in this process, suppressor-26 (sup-26) and NHL (NCL-1, HT2A, and LIN-41 repeat) domain-containing-2 (nhl-2), encode RNA-binding proteins, thus delineating a previously unknown post-transcriptional regulatory subnetwork within the well-studied sex determination pathway of Caenorhabditis elegans. Repression of nhl-2 by the mir-35 family is required for not only proper sex determination but also viability, showing that a single microRNA target site can be essential. Since sex determination in C. elegans requires zygotic gene expression to read the sex chromosome karyotype, early embryos must remain gender-naïve; our findings show that the mir-35 family microRNAs act in the early embryo to function as a developmental timer that preserves naïveté and prevents premature deleterious developmental decisions.},

We herein report a class of miRNA recognition elements (MREs) that exclusively function in CDS regions in humans. Through functional and mechanistic characterization of these “unusual” MREs, we demonstrate that CDS-targeted miRNAs require extensive base pairings in the 3’ side rather than the 5’ seed; cause gene silencing in an Argonaute-dependent, but GW182-independent manner; and repress translation by inducing transient ribosome stalling instead of mRNA destabilization. These findings reveal distinct mechanisms and functional consequences for miRNAs to target CDS versus 3’UTR and suggest that CDS-targeted miRNAs may enlist a translational quality control (QC)-related mechanism to regulate translation in mammalian cells.},

	abstract = {Synaptic downscaling is a homeostatic mechanism that allows neurons to reduce firing rates during chronically elevated network activity. Although synaptic downscaling is important in neural circuit development and epilepsy, the underlying mechanisms are poorly described. We performed small RNA profiling in picrotoxin (PTX)‐treated hippocampal neurons, a model of synaptic downscaling. Thereby, we identified eight microRNAs (miRNAs) that were increased in response to PTX, including miR‐129‐5p, whose inhibition blocked synaptic downscaling in vitro and reduced epileptic seizure severity in vivo. Using transcriptome, proteome, and bioinformatic analysis, we identified the calcium pump Atp2b4 and doublecortin (Dcx) as miR‐129‐5p targets. Restoring Atp2b4 and Dcx expression was sufficient to prevent synaptic downscaling in PTX‐treated neurons. Furthermore, we characterized a functional crosstalk between miR‐129‐5p and the RNA‐binding protein (RBP) Rbfox1. In the absence of PTX, Rbfox1 promoted the expression of Atp2b4 and Dcx. Upon PTX treatment, Rbfox1 expression was downregulated by miR‐129‐5p, thereby allowing the repression of Atp2b4 and Dcx. We therefore identified a novel activity‐dependent miRNA/RBP crosstalk during synaptic scaling, with potential implications for neural network homeostasis and epileptogenesis.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-studied small noncoding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation in a wide range of organisms, including mammals. Their function is mediated by base pairing with their target RNAs. Although many features required for miRNA-mediated repression have been described, the identification of functional interactions is still challenging. In the last two decades, numerous Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed to predict their putative targets. In this review, we summarize the biological knowledge and the experimental data used to develop these ML models. Recently, Deep Neural Network-based models have also emerged in miRNA interaction modeling. We thus outline established and emerging models to give a perspective on the future developments needed to improve the identification of genes directly regulated by miRNAs.},

However, the mRNAs regulated by vertebrate miRNAs are all unknown. Here we predict more than 400 regulatory target genes for the conserved vertebrate miRNAs by identifying mRNAs with conserved pairing to the 5′ region of the miRNA and evaluating the number and quality of these complementary sites. Rigorous tests using shuffled miRNA controls supported a majority of these predictions, with the fraction of false positives estimated at 31\% for targets identified in human, mouse, and rat and 22\% for targets identified in pufferfish as well as mammals. Eleven predicted targets (out of 15 tested) were supported experimentally using a HeLa cell reporter system. The predicted regulatory targets of mammalian miRNAs were enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation but also encompassed an unexpectedly broad range of other functions.},

Robust prediction of miRNA-mRNA pairs is of utmost importance in deciphering gene regulations but has been challenging because of high false positive rates, despite a deluge of computational tools that normally require laborious manual feature extraction. This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning framework for miRNA target prediction. Leveraged by deep recurrent neural networks-based auto-encoding and sequence-sequence interaction learning, our approach not only delivers an unprecedented level of accuracy but also eliminates the need for manual feature extraction. The performance gap between the proposed method and existing alternatives is substantial (over 25\% increase in F-measure), and deepTarget delivers a quantum leap in the long-standing challenge of robust miRNA target prediction.},

Our analysis is based on a novel compendium of experimentally verified miRNA-pathway and miRNA-process associations that we constructed, which can be a useful resource by itself. Our method also predicts novel miRNA-regulated pathways, refines the annotation of miRNAs for which only crude functions are known, and assigns differential functions to miRNAs with closely related sequences. Applying our approach to groups of co-expressed genes allows us to identify miRNAs and genomic miRNA clusters with functional importance in specific stages of early human development.

Based on this methodology, we provide a user-friendly web application that supports the statistical assessment of miRNA target enrichment analysis (miTEA) in the top of a ranked list of genes or proteins. Using miTEA, we analyze several target prediction tools by examining performance on public miRNA constitutive expression data. We also apply miTEA to analyze several integrative biology data sets, including a novel matched miRNA/mRNA data set covering nine human tissue types. Our novel findings include proposed direct activity of miR-519 in placenta, a direct activity of the oncogenic miR-15 in different healthy tissue types and a direct activity of the poorly characterized miR-768 in both healthy tissue types and cancer cell lines.

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous small regulatory RNAs, play important roles in many biological and physiological processes. The perturbations of some miRNAs, which are usually called as onco-microRNAs (onco-miRs), are significantly associated with multiple stages of cancer. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been discovered, the perturbed miRNA regulatory networks and their functions are still poorly understood in cancer. Analyzing the expression patterns of miRNA target genes is a very useful strategy to infer the perturbed miRNA networks. However, due to the complexity of cancer transcriptome, current methods often encounter low sensitivity and report few onco-miR candidates. Here, we developed a new method, named miRHiC (enrichment analysis of miRNA targets in Hierarchical gene Co-expression signatures), to infer the perturbed miRNA regulatory networks by using the hierarchical co-expression signatures in large-scale cancer gene expression datasets. The method can infer onco-miR candidates and their target networks which are only linked to sub-clusters of the differentially expressed genes at fine scales of the co-expression hierarchy. On two real datasets of lung cancer and hepatocellular cancer, miRHiC uncovered several known onco-miRs and their target genes (such as miR-26, miR-29, miR-124, miR-125 and miR-200) and also identified many new candidates (such as miR-149, which is inferred in both types of cancers). Using hierarchical gene co-expression signatures, miRHiC can greatly increase the sensitivity for inferring the perturbed miRNA regulatory networks in cancer. All Perl scripts of miRHiC and the detailed documents are freely available on the web at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/jgu/miRHiC/.},

	abstract = {Stress plays a major role in inducing depression, which may arise from interplay between complex cascades of molecular and cellular events that influence gene expression leading to altered connectivity and neural plasticity. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have carved their own niche owing to their innate ability to induce disease phenotype by regulating expression of a large number of genes in a cohesive and coordinated manner. In this study, we examined whether miRNAs and associated gene networks have a role in chronic corticosterone (CORT; 50 mg kg−1 × 21 days)-mediated depression in rats. Rats given chronic CORT showed key behavioral features that resembled depression phenotype. Expression analysis revealed differential regulation of 26 miRNAs (19 upregulated, 7 downregulated) in prefrontal cortex of CORT-treated rats. Interaction between altered miRNAs and target genes showed dense interconnected molecular network, in which multiple genes were predicated to be targeted by the same miRNA. A majority of altered miRNAs showed binding sites for glucocorticoid receptor element, suggesting that there may be a common regulatory mechanism of miRNA regulation by CORT. Functional clustering of predicated target genes yielded disorders such as developmental, inflammatory and psychological that could be relevant to depression. Prediction analysis of the two most prominently affected miRNAs miR-124 and miR-218 resulted into target genes that have been shown to be associated with depression and stress-related disorders. Altogether, our study suggests miRNA-mediated novel mechanism by which chronic CORT may be involved in depression pathophysiology.},

Positive affect is associated with favorable psychological, physical, and economic outcomes in many longitudinal studies. With a heritability of ≤64\%, positive affect is substantially influenced by genetic factors; however, our understanding of genetic pathways underlying individual differences in positive affect is still limited. Here, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of positive affect in African American participants, we identify a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs322931, significantly associated with positive affect at p{\textless}5×10−8, and replicate this association in another cohort. Furthermore, we show that the minor allele of rs322931 predicts expression of microRNAs miR-181a and miR-181b in human brain and blood, greater nucleus accumbens reactivity to positive emotional stimuli, and enhanced fear inhibition. Prior studies have suggested that miR-181a is part of the reward neurocircuitry. Taken together, we identify a novel genetic variant for further elucidation of genetic underpinning of positive affect that mediates positive emotionality potentially via the nucleus accumbens and miR-181.},

	abstract = {While the immunological dysfunction in combat Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been well documented, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The current study evaluated the role of microRNA (miR) in immunological dysfunction associated with PTSD. The presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and various lymphocyte subsets in blood collected from PTSD patients were analyzed. Our studies demonstrated that the numbers of both PBMC and various lymphocyte subsets increased significantly in PTSD patients. When T cells were further analyzed, the percentage of Th1 cells and Th17 cells increased, regulatory T cells(Tregs) decreased, while Th2 cells remained unaltered in PTSD patients. These data correlated with increased plasma levels of IFN-γ and IL-17 while IL-4 showed no significant change. The increase in PBMC counts, Th1 and Th17 cells seen in PTSD patients correlated with the clinical scores. High-throughput analysis of PBMCs for 1163 miRs showed that the expression of a significant number of miRs was altered in PTSD patients. Pathway analysis of dysregulated miRs seen in PTSD patients revealed relationship between selected miRNAs and genes that showed direct/indirect role in immunological signaling pathways consistent with the immunological changes seen in these patients. Of interest was the down-regulation of miR-125a in PTSD, which specifically targeted IFN-γ production. Together, the current study demonstrates for the first time that PTSD was associated with significant alterations in miRNAs, which may promote pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Such epigenetic events may provide useful tools to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis, and facilitate therapy of PTSD.},

MicroRNA profiling for identifying miRNAs regulating cocaine-induced, plasticity-related genes revealed significant regulation of a set of miRNAs upon cocaine administration, especially let-7d, miR-181a and the brain-specific miR-124. These miRNAs target many genes involved in cocaine addiction. Precursor and mature miRNA quantification by qRT-PCR showed that miR-124 and let-7d are significantly downregulated, whereas miR-181a is induced in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system under chronic cocaine administration. Results were confirmed by in situ hybridization, Northern blots, FISH analysis and RNase protection assay. Using lentiviral-mediated miRNA expression, we show a significant downregulation of BDNF and D3R both at mRNA and protein levels by miR-124 and let-7d, respectively. Our data suggest that miR-124, let-7d and miR-181a may be involved in a complex feedback loop with cocaine-responsive plasticity genes, highlighting the possibility that some miRNAs are key regulators of the reward circuit and may be implicated in addiction.},

NAcc is largely composed of two distinct subpopulations of medium-sized spiny neurons expressing high levels of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. In the present study, we analyzed dendritic spine density after chronic cocaine treatment in distinct D1 or D2 receptor-containing medium-sized spiny neurons in NAcc. These studies made use of transgenic mice that expressed EGFP under the control of either the D1 or D2 receptor promoter (Drd1-EGFP or Drd2-EGFP). After 28 days of cocaine treatment and 2 days of withdrawal, spine density increased in both Drd1-EGFP- and Drd2-EGFP-positive neurons. However, the increase in spine density was maintained only in Drd1-EGFP-positive neurons 30 days after drug withdrawal. Notably, increased ΔFosB expression also was observed in Drd1-EGFP- and Drd2-EGFP-positive neurons after 2 days of drug withdrawal but only in Drd1-EGFP-positive neurons after 30 days of drug withdrawal. These results suggest that the increased spine density observed after chronic cocaine treatment is stable only in D1-receptor-containing neurons and that ΔFosB expression is associated with the formation and/or the maintenance of dendritic spines in D1 as well as D2 receptor-containing neurons in NAcc.},

	abstract = {Addiction — the loss of control over drug use — involves stable brain changes that are responsible for the long-lasting nature of the behavioural abnormalities. Although drugs of abuse comprise chemically divergent molecules, their actions in the brain converge in some common points. In particular, all of them lead to the activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system — a main reward system of the brain. One likely mechanism of addiction is that repeated stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system leads to marked alterations in reinforcement mechanisms and motivational state. Different molecular modifications have been put forward to explain the long-lasting nature of addiction. For example, transcriptional modifications are thought to be crucial for the development of addictive states. The two main transcriptional regulators known to change upon repeated drug exposure are CREB and ΔFosB. Increased transcription of the CREB gene accompanies the upregulation of the cAMP pathway known to occur in certain brain regions after repeated drug intake. Upregulation of the cAMP pathway and CREB might mediate a homeostatic adaptation that diminishes further drug responsiveness. However, as the increased levels of CREB have a relatively short life, additional mechanisms are thought to underlie longer-lasting manifestations of addiction. The levels of ΔFosB, another transcriptional regulator, are also increased after administration of drugs of abuse. As the half-life of this molecule is very long, it provides a molecular mechanism of addiction based in the stability of the protein by which drug-induced changes in gene expression can persist long after drug intake stops.Other mechanisms independent of transcription might contribute to the long-term plastic changes underlying addiction. For instance, reduced protein degradation and the regulation of receptor sensitivity are two modifications known to occur after drug administration. Similarly, structural changes in the neurons of the mesolimbic dopamine system and their targets, such as increased spine density in the nucleus accumbens, are known to accompany repeated drug exposure.There are many parallels between the molecular changes underlying addiction and those related to other forms of brain plasticity such as learning and memory. From a behavioural perspective, certain features of addiction, such as the ability of drug-associated cues to induce relapse, have been described as forms of memory. Also, activation of the cAMP pathway and of CREB-mediated transcription has been observed in forms of synaptic plasticity believed to constitute cellular correlates of memory. As a result, the key future challenges in the addiction and the memory fields are equivalent to a large extent.},

The diagnoses of drug use disorders is still mainly based on subjective report and no objective biomarkers available. Many animal and cell studies found that miRNAs were involved in substance use disorders, including alcohol, morphine, cocaine and amphetamine use disorders. However, no study on circulating miRNAs for drug use disorders so far. We investigated the differential expression of plasma miRNAs in 124 patients with methamphetamine (MA) use disorders. Based on the preliminary results from microarray screen, plasma expression of 6 candidate miRNAs were measured by Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We found that the expression of miR181a, miR15b, miR- let-7e, miR- let-7d in plasma were decreased compared to normal controls. The expression of the altered miRNAs were negative correlated with drug use frequencies in past months. Our findings suggested that miR-181a, miR-15b, miR-let-7e and miR-let-7d may play a potential role in the pathology of MA use disorder, and could serve as a potential peripheral biomarker for MA use disorder when confirmed by future studies. Further study are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism modulated by miRNAs and explore potential novel intervention targets.},

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important posttranscriptional regulators of synaptic plasticity, but whether they target glutamate receptors to mediate this effect is not known. Here we used microarray screening to identify miRNAs that regulate synaptic plasticity within the nucleus accumbens, a brain region critical to forming drug-seeking habits. One of the miRNAs that showed a robust enrichment at medium spiny neuron synapses was miR-181a. Using bioinformatics tools, we detected a highly conserved miR-181a binding site within the mRNA encoding the GluA2 subunit of AMPA-Rs. Overexpression and knockdown of miR-181a in primary neurons demonstrated that this miRNA is a negative posttranscriptional regulator of GluA2 expression. Additionally, miR-181a overexpression reduced GluA2 surface expression, spine formation, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that miR-181a could regulate synaptic function. Moreover, miR-181a expression was induced by dopamine signaling in primary neurons, as well as by cocaine and amphetamines, in a mouse model of chronic drug treatment. Taken together, our results identify miR-181a as a key regulator of mammalian AMPA-type glutamate receptors, with potential implications for the regulation of drug-induced synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {microRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules negatively regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level in many tissues including the central nervous system. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a key nuclear factor highly expressed in hippocampal neurons on which many signal pathways converge. Recent studies have found that microRNA-181a is rich in mature nerve cells, and bioinformatics analysis shows that the CREB1 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) contains complementary sequence to the miR-181a seed region. In this study, we investigated whether miR-181a is a negative regulator for CREB1 expression in neurons. It was found that the expression of miR-181a was negatively correlated with Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and CREB1 in the Lewis rat hippocampus. miR-181a bound to CREB1 mRNA through a specific binding site in the 3'UTR sequence. The expression of CREB1 in PC12 cells was down-regulated by transfection with a miR-181a mimic and up-regulated by a miR-181a inhibitor. A down-regulated miR-181a and an up-regulated CREB1 were observed in IGF-1-stimulated PC12 cells. And miR-181a inhibited dendritic growth of cultured hippocampus neurons. These suggest that miR-181a is involved in IGF-1-regulated CREB1 expression by targeting its mRNA 3'UTR. microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are involved in the central nervous system development. Here, we demonstrate that miR-181a can inhibit the expression of the transcription factor CREB1 by specifically targeting its mRNA 3'UTR and inhibit the development of hippocampus neurons. Repressed expression of miR-181a is involved in IGF-1-mediated up-regulation of CREB1 in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that miR-181a could be a potential target for preventing neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we identify the microRNAs miR‐181a and miR‐181b as key regulators of retinal axon specification and growth. Loss of miR‐181a/b in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) failed to consolidate amacrine cell processes into axons and delayed the growth of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. These alterations were accompanied by defects in visual connectivity and function. We demonstrated that miR‐181a/b exert these actions through negative modulation of MAPK/ERK signaling that in turn leads to RhoA reduction and proper neuritogenesis in both amacrine cells and RGCs via local cytoskeletal rearrangement. Our results identify a new pathway for axon specification and growth unraveling a crucial role of miR‐181a/b in the proper establishment of visual system connectivity and function. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Subtle variations in the expression levels of key molecules may result in a variety of axonal growth anomalies. miR-181a and miR-181b are two eye-enriched microRNAs whose inactivation in medaka fish leads to alterations of the proper establishment of connectivity and function in the visual system. miR-181a/b are fundamental regulators of MAPK signaling and their role in retinal axon growth and specification is just beginning to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that miR-181a/b are key nodes in the interplay between TGF-β and MAPK/ERK within the functional pathways that control retinal axon specification and growth. Using a variety of in vivo and in vitro approaches in medaka fish, we demonstrate that TGF-β signaling controls the miR-181/ERK regulatory network, which in turn strengthens the TGF-β-mediated regulation of RhoA degradation. Significantly, these data uncover the role of TGF-β signaling in vivo, for the first time, in defining the correct wiring and assembly of functional retina neural circuits and further highlight miR-181a/b as key factors in axon specification and growth.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression. The majority of miRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences into primary miRNAs and processed into precursor miRNAs, and finally mature miRNAs. In most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational repression. However, interaction of miRNAs with other regions, including the 5′ UTR, coding sequence, and gene promoters, have also been reported. Under certain conditions, miRNAs can also activate translation or regulate transcription. The interaction of miRNAs with their target genes is dynamic and dependent on many factors, such as subcellular location of miRNAs, the abundancy of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. miRNAs can be secreted into extracellular fluids and transported to target cells via vesicles, such as exosomes, or by binding to proteins, including Argonautes. Extracellular miRNAs function as chemical messengers to mediate cell-cell communication. In this review, we provide an update on canonical and non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways and various mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulations. We also summarize the current knowledge of the dynamics of miRNA action and of the secretion, transfer, and uptake of extracellular miRNAs.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous single-stranded RNA molecules of about 21 nucleotides in length that are fundamental post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Although the transcriptional and processing events involved in the generation of miRNAs have been extensively studied, very little is known pertaining to components that regulate the stability of individual miRNAs. All RNAs have distinct inherent half-lives that dictate their level of accumulation and miRNAs would be expected to follow a similar principle. Here we demonstrate that although most miRNA appear to be stable, like mRNAs, miRNAs possess differential stability in human cells. In particular, we found that miR-382, a miRNA that contributes to HIV-1 provirus latency, is unstable in cells. To determine the region of miR-382 responsible for its rapid decay, we developed a cell-free system that recapitulated the observed cell-based-regulated miR-382 turnover. The system utilizes in vitro-processed mature miRNA derived from pre-miRNA and follows the decay of the processed miRNA. Using this system, we demonstrate that instability of miR-382 is driven by sequences outside its seed region and required the 3′ terminal seven nucleotides where mutations in this region increased the stability of the RNA. Moreover, the exosome 3′–5′ exoribonuclease complex was identified as the primary nuclease involved in miR-382 decay with a more modest contribution by the Xrn1 and no detectable contribution by Xrn2. These studies provide evidence for an miRNA element essential for rapid miRNA decay and implicate the exosome in this process. The development of a biochemically amendable system to analyze the mechanism of differential miRNA stability provides an important step in efforts to regulate gene expression by modulating miRNA stability.},

Here, we used approach-to-equilibrium metabolic labeling to assess these rates for 176 miRNAs in contact-inhibited mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), 182 miRNAs in dividing MEFs, and 136 miRNAs in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). MicroRNA duplexes, each comprising a mature miRNA and its passenger strand, are produced at rates as fast as 114 ± 49 copies/cell per min, which exceeds rates reported for any mRNAs. These duplexes are rapidly loaded into Argonaute, with \&lt;10 min typically required for duplex loading and silencing-complex maturation. Within Argonaute, guide strands have stabilities that vary by 100-fold. Half-lives also vary globally between cell lines, with median values ranging from 6.3 to 34 h in mESCs and contact-inhibited MEFs, respectively. Moreover, relative half-lives for individual miRNAs vary between cell types, implying the influence of cell-specific factors in dictating turnover rate. The apparent influence of miRNA regions most important for targeting, together with the effect of one target on miR-7a-5p accumulation, suggest that targets fulfill this role. Analysis of the tailing and trimming of miRNA 3′ termini showed that the flux was typically greatest through the isoform tailed with a single uridine, although changes in this flux did not correspond to changes in stability, which suggested that the processes of tailing and trimming might be independent from that of decay. Together these results establish a framework for describing the dynamics and regulation of miRNAs throughout their lifecycle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA guide molecules that regulate gene expression via association with effector complexes and sequence-specific recognition of target sites on other RNAs; misregulated microRNA expression and functions are linked to a variety of tumors, developmental disorders, and immune disease. MicroRNAs have primarily been demonstrated to mediate posttranscriptional downregulation of expression; translational repression, and deadenylation-dependent decay of messages through partially complementary microRNA target sites in mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs). However, an emerging assortment of studies, discussed in this review, reveal that microRNAs and their associated protein complexes (microribonucleoproteins or microRNPs) can additionally function to posttranscriptionally stimulate gene expression by direct and indirect mechanisms. These reports indicate that microRNA-mediated effects can be selective, regulated by the RNA sequence context, and associated with RNP factors and cellular conditions. Like repression, translation upregulation by microRNAs has been observed to range from fine-tuning effects to significant alterations in expression. These studies uncover remarkable, new abilities of microRNAs and associated microRNPs in gene expression control and underscore the importance of regulation, in cis and trans, in directing appropriate microRNP responses.

Important for target recognition are ∼7 nt sites that match the seed region of the miRNA. However, these seed matches are not always sufficient for repression, indicating that other characteristics help specify targeting. By combining computational and experimental approaches, we uncovered five general features of site context that boost site efficacy: AU-rich nucleotide composition near the site, proximity to sites for coexpressed miRNAs (which leads to cooperative action), proximity to residues pairing to miRNA nucleotides 13–16, positioning within the 3′UTR at least 15 nt from the stop codon, and positioning away from the center of long UTRs. A model combining these context determinants quantitatively predicts site performance both for exogenously added miRNAs and for endogenous miRNA-message interactions.

Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5′-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5′ end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5′ end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5′ phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi–RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere7, provide direct support for the 5′ region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5′ end of the guide RNA.},

Despite these similarities, plant and animal miRNAs exert their control in fundamentally different ways. Generally, animal miRNAs repress gene expression by mediating translational attenuation through (multiple) miRNA-binding sites located within the 3′ untranslated region of the target gene. In contrast, almost all plant miRNAs regulate their targets by directing mRNA cleavage at single sites in the coding regions.

	abstract = {A key step in RNA interference (RNAi) is assembly of the RISC, the protein-siRNA complex that mediates target RNA cleavage. Here, we show that the two strands of an siRNA duplex are not equally eligible for assembly into RISC. Rather, both the absolute and relative stabilities of the base pairs at the 5′ ends of the two siRNA strands determine the degree to which each strand participates in the RNAi pathway. siRNA duplexes can be functionally asymmetric, with only one of the two strands able to trigger RNAi. Asymmetry is the hallmark of a related class of small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs). We suggest that single-stranded miRNAs are initially generated as siRNA-like duplexes whose structures predestine one strand to enter the RISC and the other strand to be destroyed. Thus, the common step of RISC assembly is an unexpected source of asymmetry for both siRNA function and miRNA biogenesis.},

In addition to repressing translation, miRNAs can down-regulate the concentration of mRNAs that contain elements to which they are imperfectly complementary. Using miR-125b and let-7 as representative miRNAs, we show that in mammalian cells this reduction in message abundance is a consequence of accelerated deadenylation, which leads to rapid mRNA decay. The ability of miRNAs to expedite poly(A) removal does not result from decreased translation; nor does translational repression by miRNAs require a poly(A) tail, a 3′ histone stem-loop being an effective substitute. These findings suggest that miRNAs use two distinct posttranscriptional mechanisms to down-regulate gene expression.},

In animals, most known miRNA targeting occurs within the 3′UTR of mRNAs, but the extent of biologically relevant targeting in the ORF or 5′UTR of mRNAs remains unknown. Here, we develop an algorithm (MinoTar—miRNA ORF Targets) to identify conserved regulatory motifs within protein-coding regions and use it to estimate the number of preferentially conserved miRNA-target sites in ORFs. We show that, in Drosophila, preferentially conserved miRNA targeting in ORFs is as widespread as it is in 3′UTRs and that, while far less abundant, conserved targets in Drosophila 5′UTRs number in the hundreds. Using our algorithm, we predicted a set of high-confidence ORF targets and selected seven miRNA-target pairs from among these for experimental validation. We observed down-regulation by the miRNA in five out of seven cases, indicating our approach can recover functional sites with high confidence. Additionally, we observed additive targeting by multiple sites within a single ORF. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the scale of biologically important miRNA targeting in ORFs is extensive and that computational tools such as ours can aid in the identification of such targets. Further evidence suggests that our results extend to mammals, but that the extent of ORF and 5′UTR targeting relative to 3′UTR targeting may be greater in Drosophila.},

The human genome codes for hundreds of different miRNAs and it is predicted that they target thousands of mRNAs involved in a wide variety of physiological processes such as development and cell identity. In animals, the identification of mRNA targets is complex because most miRNAs and their target mRNAs do not have exact or nearly exact complementarity. This tendency of animal miRNAs to bind their mRNA targets with imperfect sequence homology represents a considerable challenge to identifying miRNA targets. Computational algorithms based on conservation and experimental approaches based on expression profiles are flooding the literature with lists of candidate genes containing a large number of false-positive and false-negative predictions and indirect targets that cover the real list of direct targets for each miRNA. Currently, the only available tools to validate a sequence as a direct target of an miRNA are the systems based on a reporter gene carrying the candidate sequence. Here, an miRNA target validation reporter gene system based on the luminescence generated by the luciferase protein is described in detail, including the design of the reporter constructs, its expression in a model cell line and its measurement using a luciferase assay.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short ({\textasciitilde}22 nt) single stranded RNAs that downregulate gene expression. Although recent studies indicate extensive miRNA changes in response to ischemic brain injury, there is currently little information on the roles of specific miRNAs in this setting. Heat shock proteins (HSP) of the HSP70 family have been extensively studied for their multiple roles in cellular protection, but there is little information on their regulation by miRNAs. We used bioinformatics to identify miR-181 as a possible regulator of several HSP70 family members. We validated GRP78/BIP as a target by dual luciferase assay. In response to stroke in the mouse we find that miR-181 increases in the core, where cells die, but decreases in the penumbra, where cells survive. Increased levels of miR-181a are associated with decreased GRP78 protein levels, but increased levels of mRNA, implicating translational arrest. We manipulated levels of miR-181a using plasmid overexpression of pri-miR-181ab or mimic to increase, and antagomir or inhibitor to reduce levels. Increased miR-181a exacerbated injury both in vitro and in the mouse stroke model. Conversely, reduced levels were associated with reduced injury and increased GRP78 protein levels. Studies in C6 cells show that if GRP78 levels are maintained miR-181a no longer exerts a toxic effect. These data demonstrate that miR-181 levels change in response to stroke and inversely correlate with levels of GRP78. Importantly, reducing or blocking miR-181a protects the brain from stroke.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Posttranscriptional repression by microRNA (miRNA) occurs through transcript destabilization or translation inhibition. Whereas RNA degradation explains most miRNA-dependent repression, transcript decay occurs co-translationally, raising questions regarding the requirement of target translation to miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization. To assess the contribution of translation to miRNA-mediated RNA destabilization, we decoupled these two molecular processes by dissecting the impact of miRNA loss of function on cytosolic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We show, that despite interacting with miRNA loaded RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), the steady state abundance and degradation rates of these endogenously expressed non-translated transcripts are minimally impacted by miRNA loss. To validate the requirement of translation for miRNA-dependent decay, we fused a miRISC bound lncRNA, whose levels are unaffected by miRNAs, to the 3’end of a protein-coding gene reporter and show that this results in its miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization. Furthermore, analysis of the few lncRNAs whose levels are regulated by miRNAs revealed these tend to associate with translating ribosomes and are likely misannotated micropeptides, further substantiating the necessity of target translation for miRNA-dependent transcript decay. Our analyses reveal the strict requirement of translation for miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization and demonstrate that the levels of coding and noncoding transcripts are differently affected by miRNAs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases., Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference.

This project evaluated 8 billion small RNA-seq reads from 46 primary cell types, 42 cancer or immortalized cell lines, and 26 tissues. It identified both specific and ubiquitous patterns of expression that strongly correlate with adjacent superenhancer activity. Analysis of unaligned RNA reads uncovered 207 unknown minor strand (passenger) microRNAs of known microRNA loci and 495 novel putative microRNA loci. Although cancer cell lines generally recapitulated the expression patterns of matched primary cells, their isomiR sequence families exhibited increased disorder, suggesting DROSHA- and DICER1-dependent microRNA processing variability. Cell-specific patterns of microRNA expression were used to de-convolute variable cellular composition of colon and adipose tissue samples, highlighting one use of these cell-specific microRNA expression data.

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) derived from back-spliced exons have been widely identified as being co-expressed with their linear counterparts. A single gene locus can produce multiple circRNAs through alternative back-splice site selection and/or alternative splice site selection; however, a detailed map of alternative back-splicing/splicing in circRNAs is lacking. Here, with the upgraded CIRCexplorer2 pipeline, we systematically annotated different types of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing events in circRNAs from various cell lines. Compared with their linear cognate RNAs, circRNAs exhibited distinct patterns of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing. Alternative back-splice site selection was correlated with the competition of putative RNA pairs across introns that bracket alternative back-splice sites. In addition, all four basic types of alternative splicing that have been identified in the (linear) mRNA process were found within circRNAs, and many exons were predominantly spliced in circRNAs. Unexpectedly, thousands of previously unannotated exons were detected in circRNAs from the examined cell lines. Although these novel exons had similar splice site strength, they were much less conserved than known exons in sequences. Finally, both alternative back-splicing and circRNA-predominant alternative splicing were highly diverse among the examined cell lines. All of the identified alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing in circRNAs are available in the CIRCpedia database (http://www.picb.ac.cn/rnomics/circpedia). Collectively, the annotation of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing in circRNAs provides a valuable resource for depicting the complexity of circRNA biogenesis and for studying the potential functions of circRNAs in different cells.},
